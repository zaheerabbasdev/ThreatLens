# ThreatLens Backend

Node.js + Express + TypeScript API for ThreatLens. Phase 3 (Backend architecture and API)
of the build — see `../.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `../ThreatLens/03-BACKEND-DATABASE-SECURITY-DEVSECOPS-RULES.md`
for the full rules this follows.

## Status

**Infrastructure** (increment 1): Express app, security middleware, centralized error
handling, structured logging, request correlation IDs, tiered rate limiting, health check.

**Auth** (increment 2): registration, login, logout, token refresh, password reset, password
change, email verification, RBAC middleware — all real, tested, and verified against a real
running server, not just in-process. Details:

- Argon2id password hashing (spec §14)
- JWT access tokens (15m) + rotating refresh tokens (30d) delivered via a scoped, httpOnly,
  `SameSite=Strict` cookie; explicit algorithm allowlist + issuer/audience validation on every
  verify (spec §17)
- Refresh token rotation with reuse detection — presenting an already-consumed refresh token
  revokes its entire session family, not just that one token
- Login/registration responses are indistinguishable for "wrong password" vs "no such
  account"; account-status details (suspended, etc.) are only revealed once the password is
  already proven correct (spec §24)
- RBAC via `requireAuth` + `requirePermission(permission)` — the actual enforcement point;
  the frontend's matching checks are UX only (spec §18)
- Password reset / email verification tokens are single-use, short-lived, and stored only as
  a SHA-256 digest (spec §14)

**Incidents** (increment 3): `GET /incidents`, `GET /incidents/summary`, `GET /incidents/:id`,
`PATCH /incidents/:id/status`, `PATCH /incidents/:id/assign`, `POST /incidents/:id/notes` — the
first domain module, establishing the pattern the rest (alerts, investigations, users, ...)
follow:

- Every repository method takes `organizationId` as a required argument and enforces it at
  the data-access layer (spec §20) — `getById` returns the same "not found" for a genuinely
  missing ID and an ID that belongs to another organization, so changing the ID in the URL
  can't be used to probe what exists elsewhere (spec §19, verified by an explicit
  register-a-new-org-then-probe test)
- Assigning an incident validates the assignee belongs to the same organization too — the
  object-level check extends to referenced resources, not just the one in the URL
  path
- Note authorship is resolved from the authenticated session server-side; a client-supplied
  author name in the request body is ignored, not trusted
- RBAC per-route via the existing `requirePermission`, exercised against every seeded role

**Not yet built** (later increments of this same phase, or later phases entirely — nothing
below is silently faked):

- Remaining domain routes (alerts, investigations, threat intel, users, reports, audit logs,
  MITRE, threat graph) — next increments, following the incidents pattern
- A real database — Phase 5. Repositories are in-memory, behind the same interfaces a MongoDB
  implementation will fulfill later; nothing above that seam needs to change when it does.
- Real email delivery — no mailer exists yet, so `forgotPassword`/registration hand the raw
  token back in the API response when `NODE_ENV !== production` (never in production) so the
  flow is testable end to end. This is a real, working token — just delivered by a different
  channel than production will eventually use.
- Real AI/OpenAI calls — Phase 6
- Real threat-intel provider integrations — Phase 7

## Development

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in required values
npm install
npm run dev             # tsx watch, http://localhost:4000
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run build && npm start
```

## Structure

```
src/
  config/      environment loading & validation (fails fast on missing/invalid config)
  errors/      AppError hierarchy — the only errors safe to describe to a client
  middleware/  request ID, security headers/CORS, rate limiting, error handling
  routes/      versioned under /api/v1
  utils/       logger (Pino, redacts secrets), API response envelope
  types/       ambient type augmentations
  app.ts       assembles the Express app (no side effects — safe to import in tests)
  server.ts    entry point: starts the HTTP server, handles graceful shutdown
```

`app.ts` and `server.ts` are deliberately split so tests can exercise the app via
`supertest` without binding a real port.
